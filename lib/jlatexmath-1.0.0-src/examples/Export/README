In using fop 0.95 it's possible to generate PDF, PS or EPS via a SVG file.
The glyphs can be converted into path to avoid the embedding of the fonts and make readable SVG files for the web or other usage.

To compile check you have put in the classpath or in a directory you can precise in build.xml (with the variable myclasspath), the following jars :
   fop.jar
   avalon-framework.jar
   xml-apis-ext.jar
   commons-io.jar
   commons-logging.jar
